What is ShopChest?
ShopChest is a plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft server software that allows players to engage in economic transactions via chests.
Players can set up and manage shops linked to chests that other players can shop from, paying through iConomy integration.

What features are included?
Currently, players can (with the correct Permissions):
- Create shops
- Delete their shops
- Set player-specific prices
- Set shop-specific prices
- Set sales on their shops
- Allow certain items to be sold back to their shops

Transactions are computed serverside and completed through iConomy integration.  The plugin monitors players as they shop, preventing fraud.
iConomy versions 5 and 6 are supported, as well as Permissions 2.7 and Bukkit permissions.
